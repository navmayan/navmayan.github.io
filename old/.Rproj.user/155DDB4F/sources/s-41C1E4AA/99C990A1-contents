I am a doctoral student in the Department of Psychology at Ben-Gurion University. I work with [Yoav Bar-Anan](https://www.tau.ac.il/~baranan/) in the Social Perception Lab.

I study social cognition, mainly attitude formation, intergroup relations, and motivation.
In my dissertation research, I study Bivalent Memory: Memory processes that link the same object to two opposite values. In particular, I investigate the factors that moderate information integration. 

My M.A. thesis explored the effects of conflict mindset on the visual mental representation of the ingroup and outgroup.
