I am a doctoral student in Social Psychology at Ben-Gurion University and Tel-Aviv University. 
I work with Yoav Bar-Anan in the [Social Perception Lab](https://www.tau.ac.il/~baranan/). 
I received my B.A. in Psychology, Sociology, and Criminology from Bar-Ilan University, and my M.A. in Social Psychology from the Open University of Israel. My Masterâ€™s thesis explored the effects of conflict mindset on the visual mental representation of the ingroup and outgroup.

<h3>My research</h3>
<br><br>

<br><br>
I study social cognition, mainly intergroup bias and intergroup relations, attitude formation, and attitudinal ambivalence. I also study facial expression synchronization.
<br><br>
<b>The effect of group membership and individuating information on automatic and deliberate judgment of individual group members.</b> The center of my work focuses on the relative effect of individuating information (e.g., person-specific actions and traits) and group based information (e.g., stereotypes, prejudice) on the automatic and deliberate evaluation of individual members of social groups.
<br><br>
<b>Tracking the dynamics of deliberate judgment: Do deliberate judgments start with automatic (spontaneous) judgments?</b> In this project, I examine whether deliberate evaluations involve automatic evaluative responses as well.
<br><br>
<b>Bivalentmemory and its moderators.</b>In this project I examine memory processes that link the same object to two opposite values. In particular, I investigate the factors that moderate information integration, and keep the two opposite values seperate in memory.
<br><br>
<b>Synchronization across various facial expressions as a function of the interaction context.</b> Here I examine whether facial expressions synchronization and mimicry vary as a function of the interpersonal interaction context, and the facial expression in question (e.g., happiness, anger).
