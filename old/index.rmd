I am a doctoral student in Social Psychology at Ben-Gurion University and Tel-Aviv University. 
I work with [Yoav Bar-Anan](https://www.tau.ac.il/~baranan/) in the Social Perception Lab. 
I received my B.A. in Psychology, Sociology, and Criminology from Bar-Ilan University, and my M.A. in Social Psychology from the Open University of Israel. 

I study social cognition, mainly intergroup bias and intergroup relations, attitude formation, attitudinal ambivalence, and motivation.
My Masterâ€™s thesis explored the effects of conflict mindset on the visual mental representation of the ingroup and outgroup.
Currently, I investigate the effect of individuating information and group based information (e.g., stereotypes) on the automatic and deliberate evaluation of individual group members.
I also study Bivalent Memory: Memory processes that link the same object to two opposite values. In particular, I investigate the factors that moderate information integration.
